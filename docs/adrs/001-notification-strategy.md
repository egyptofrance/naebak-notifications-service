# ADR-001: Multi-channel Notification Strategy and Queue Architecture

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**

The Naebak platform requires a comprehensive notification system to keep users informed about political activities, system updates, and personal communications. We needed to design a system that could handle multiple delivery channels (email, SMS, push notifications), ensure reliable delivery, support high volume, and provide delivery confirmation. Several approaches were considered, including direct synchronous delivery, third-party notification services, and queue-based asynchronous processing.

**Decision:**

We have decided to implement a multi-channel notification service using Redis-based queuing for asynchronous processing, supporting email, SMS, and push notification delivery with comprehensive tracking and retry mechanisms.

## **Core Architecture Design:**

**Queue-Based Processing** serves as the foundation for reliable notification delivery, using Redis lists to queue notifications for asynchronous processing. This approach decouples notification creation from delivery, enabling high throughput and resilient handling of delivery failures.

**Multi-Channel Support** provides unified notification handling across email, SMS, and push notification channels. Each channel has specialized delivery logic while sharing common queuing and tracking infrastructure.

**Asynchronous Delivery** ensures that notification requests return immediately while actual delivery happens in the background. This approach prevents blocking operations and provides better user experience for applications sending notifications.

## **Notification Processing Pipeline:**

**Request Validation** ensures all incoming notification requests contain required fields and valid channel specifications. Invalid requests are rejected immediately with descriptive error messages.

**Queue Management** uses Redis lists for FIFO (First In, First Out) notification processing with blocking pop operations for efficient worker coordination. The queue provides persistence and enables horizontal scaling of notification workers.

**Delivery Routing** directs notifications to appropriate channel handlers based on the specified delivery method. Each channel handler implements specific integration logic for external service providers.

## **Channel-Specific Implementations:**

**Email Notifications** support both HTML and plain text formats with template-based content generation. Integration points are designed for popular email service providers like SendGrid, AWS SES, and Mailgun.

**SMS Notifications** handle short message delivery through SMS gateway providers like Twilio and AWS SNS. Content is automatically truncated and formatted for SMS constraints.

**Push Notifications** support both web and mobile push notifications through Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and Apple Push Notification Service (APNs). Device token management and message formatting are handled transparently.

## **Reliability and Error Handling:**

**Delivery Confirmation** tracks notification delivery status and provides feedback to requesting services. Failed deliveries are logged with detailed error information for troubleshooting.

**Retry Mechanisms** handle transient delivery failures through configurable retry policies. Exponential backoff prevents overwhelming external services during outages.

**Dead Letter Queue** captures notifications that fail permanently after all retry attempts, enabling manual review and system debugging.

## **Scalability and Performance:**

**Horizontal Scaling** enables multiple notification worker processes to consume from the same queue, distributing load and improving throughput. Redis provides coordination between workers without conflicts.

**Rate Limiting** prevents overwhelming external service providers by implementing configurable rate limits for each delivery channel. This ensures compliance with provider terms and maintains service quality.

**Batch Processing** optimizes delivery performance by grouping similar notifications when supported by external providers. This reduces API calls and improves overall throughput.

## **Monitoring and Observability:**

**Queue Metrics** provide real-time visibility into queue length, processing rates, and system health. These metrics enable proactive scaling and performance optimization.

**Delivery Analytics** track success rates, failure patterns, and delivery times across all channels. This data supports service optimization and troubleshooting.

**Alert Integration** notifies operations teams of queue backlogs, delivery failures, and service outages to ensure rapid response to issues.

## **Security and Privacy:**

**Content Sanitization** ensures notification content is properly escaped and validated before delivery to prevent injection attacks and content corruption.

**Channel Security** implements appropriate security measures for each delivery channel, including TLS encryption for email and SMS, and proper authentication for push notifications.

**Data Retention** manages notification data lifecycle with configurable retention policies to comply with privacy regulations and minimize data exposure.

## **Integration Patterns:**

**Service Integration** provides simple HTTP API for other microservices to send notifications without managing delivery complexity. The API supports both immediate and scheduled notifications.

**Template System** enables consistent notification formatting across channels while supporting personalization and localization. Templates are managed centrally and versioned for consistency.

**Event-Driven Notifications** support integration with platform events through message queues or webhooks, enabling automatic notifications for user actions and system events.

**Consequences:**

**Positive:**

*   **Reliability**: Queue-based architecture ensures notifications are not lost even during service outages or high load periods.
*   **Scalability**: Asynchronous processing and horizontal scaling support high notification volumes without impacting application performance.
*   **Flexibility**: Multi-channel support enables appropriate notification delivery based on user preferences and message urgency.
*   **Maintainability**: Centralized notification logic reduces duplication across services and simplifies updates to delivery mechanisms.
*   **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and tracking provide visibility into notification system performance and user engagement.

**Negative:**

*   **Complexity**: Queue-based architecture adds operational complexity compared to direct notification delivery.
*   **Latency**: Asynchronous processing introduces delivery delays compared to immediate synchronous delivery.
*   **Dependencies**: Reliance on Redis and external service providers creates additional failure points that must be managed.

**Implementation Notes:**

The current implementation prioritizes reliability and scalability over immediate delivery. Future enhancements could include advanced scheduling capabilities, A/B testing for notification content, and integration with analytics platforms for user engagement tracking. The modular design allows for these improvements without major architectural changes while maintaining the core benefits of reliable multi-channel notification delivery.
