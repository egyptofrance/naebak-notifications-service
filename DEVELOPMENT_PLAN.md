# Naebak Notifications Service - Development Plan

## 1. Project Overview

**Goal:** Develop a comprehensive, multi-channel notification service for the Naebak platform.

**Scope:** The service will handle all platform notifications including user alerts, system notifications, and political engagement updates. It will support email, SMS, and push notifications with a template-based system and user preferences.

**Success Metrics:**
- 99.9% notification delivery rate
- Sub-second notification queuing latency
- Support for 10,000+ notifications per hour
- Comprehensive test coverage (90%+)
- Detailed API and service documentation

## 2. Architecture

**Core Components:**
- **Flask Application:** REST API for notification queuing and management
- **PostgreSQL Database:** For storing notification templates, user preferences, and delivery logs
- **Redis:** For notification queuing and processing
- **Celery:** For asynchronous task processing and delivery
- **External Providers:** Integration with SendGrid (email), Twilio (SMS), and FCM (push)

**Workflow:**
1. API receives notification request
2. Request is validated and added to Redis queue
3. Celery worker picks up notification from queue
4. Worker retrieves template and user preferences
5. Notification is sent via appropriate channel
6. Delivery status is logged in PostgreSQL

## 3. Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Models and Database Schema (1 week)

- **Task 1.1:** Design and implement PostgreSQL database schema
  - `notifications` table for delivery logs
  - `notification_templates` table for message templates
  - `user_notification_preferences` table for user settings
- **Task 1.2:** Create SQLAlchemy models for all tables
- **Task 1.3:** Set up Alembic for database migrations

### Phase 2: Notification Channels and Delivery System (2 weeks)

- **Task 2.1:** Implement email delivery channel with SendGrid
- **Task 2.2:** Implement SMS delivery channel with Twilio
- **Task 2.3:** Implement push notification channel with FCM
- **Task 2.4:** Create a unified delivery interface for all channels
- **Task 2.5:** Set up Celery for asynchronous task processing

### Phase 3: Template System and User Preferences (1 week)

- **Task 3.1:** Develop a template rendering engine (Jinja2)
- **Task 3.2:** Create API endpoints for template management
- **Task 3.3:** Implement user preference management API
- **Task 3.4:** Integrate user preferences into delivery logic

### Phase 4: Advanced Features and Integrations (1 week)

- **Task 4.1:** Implement notification batching and scheduling
- **Task 4.2:** Add delivery status tracking and retry logic
- **Task 4.3:** Integrate with naebak-auth for user data
- **Task 4.4:** Implement rate limiting and security features

### Phase 5: Testing and Documentation (1 week)

- **Task 5.1:** Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Task 5.2:** Create detailed API documentation
- **Task 5.3:** Update `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` with setup and usage instructions

### Phase 6: Deployment and Finalization (1 week)

- **Task 6.1:** Create Dockerfile for containerization
- **Task 6.2:** Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
- **Task 6.3:** Deploy to staging environment for final testing
- **Task 6.4:** Push all changes to GitHub and finalize documentation

## 4. Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask, Celery
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Testing:** Pytest, Unittest
- **Deployment:** Docker, GitHub Actions
- **External Services:** SendGrid, Twilio, FCM

## 5. Team and Responsibilities

- **Lead Developer:** Responsible for architecture and core development
- **Backend Developer:** Responsible for feature implementation and testing
- **DevOps Engineer:** Responsible for deployment and infrastructure

## 6. Risks and Mitigation

- **Provider Integration Issues:** Allocate extra time for testing and debugging
- **Scalability Challenges:** Design for high throughput from the start
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Conduct security audits and follow best practices

## 7. Timeline

- **Total Estimated Time:** 7 weeks
- **Start Date:** [Start Date]
- **End Date:** [End Date]

This development plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for creating a robust and scalable notification service for the Naebak platform. By following this plan, we can ensure timely delivery of a high-quality service that meets all project requirements.
